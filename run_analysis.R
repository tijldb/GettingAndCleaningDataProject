# Course:
# Getting and Cleaning Data
#
# Assignment

# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

# 0. First check if the data is available (if X_train.txt exists, all are supposed to)
if (!file.exists('X_train.txt')) {
	source('getting_data.R')
}

# 0.5 set B_DEBUG to TRUE if you want to keep all datasets in memory (for debugging afterwards)
#			     to FALSE for cleaning memory, i.e. removing variables when no longer in use
# R Studio keeps all variables in memory
# So I remove the ones no longer needed, this way I hope to clear memory for his operations and to avoid swapping as much as needed
 
B_DEBUG <- FALSE

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# read training set
x_train<-read.table('X_train.txt',header=FALSE)
y_train<-read.table('y_train.txt',header=FALSE)

# read test set
x_test<-read.table('X_test.txt',header=FALSE)
y_test<-read.table('y_test.txt',header=FALSE)

# union training and test (once for X and once for y)
x_ds <- rbind(x_train, x_test)
y_ds <- rbind(y_train, y_test)

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test)
}

# read both subject tables and union them
subject_train <- read.table('subject_train.txt',header=FALSE)
subject_test <- read.table('subject_test.txt',header=FALSE)
subject_ds <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(subject_train,subject_test)
}

# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

# read features and assign the feature names to the column names of x_ds (answer to question 4)
colnames <- read.table('features.txt')
names(x_ds) <- colnames[,2]
names(subject_ds)[1] = 'subject'	

# select columns to filter
mean_cols <- grep('mean()',colnames$V2,fixed=TRUE)
std_cols <- grep('std()',colnames$V2,fixed=TRUE)

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(colnames)
}

# double checking the columns filter
names(x_ds)[sort(c(mean_cols,std_cols))]

# project only the relevant columns
x_mean_std <- x_ds[,sort(c(mean_cols,std_cols))]

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(x_ds,mean_cols,std_cols)
}

# merge all three datasets on position
ds<- cbind(subject_ds,y_ds,x_mean_std)

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(x_mean_std,subject_ds,y_ds)
}

# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
activity_ds <- read.table('UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt')
names(activity_ds)[2] = 'activity'
ds <- merge(activity_ds, ds, sort=FALSE)[2:69]

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(activity_ds)
}

# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

# descriptive activity names have been set in the first part of 2

# 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

# create tidy dataset
# tidy_ds <- aggregate(ds,by=list(subject=ds$Subject,activity=ds$activity),FUN=mean)[,c(1:2,5:70)]
ds$subject <- as.factor(ds$subject)
tidy_ds <- aggregate(. ~ activity + subject,ds,mean)

if (!B_DEBUG) {
	remove(ds)
}

# write data sets in files
write.table(tidy_ds,"tidydataset.txt",row.names=FALSE)

rm(B_DEBUG)
